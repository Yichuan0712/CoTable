            "Here's my thought process:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Identify Drug Name:** The table caption mentions \"Bayesian pharmacokinetics parameters.\"  This suggests the table summarizes PK parameters for a *single* drug. The table itself doesn't explicitly name the drug.  We need to look back at the source of this table to identify the drug.  *Without the source, we cannot definitively name the drug.*\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Identify Analyte:**  Similar to the drug name, the analyte isn't explicitly stated.  Pharmacokinetic studies typically measure the concentration of the drug itself.  Therefore, it's *highly likely* that the analyte is the same as the drug. However, without the source, we can't be 100% certain.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Identify Specimen:** The table provides clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vdss), elimination rate constant (Beta), and elimination half-life (T½ Beta). These are systemic parameters, typically derived from plasma concentration-time data.  Therefore, it's *highly probable* that the specimen is plasma.  Again, confirmation requires checking the original source.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Handling Missing Information:**  As explained above, the drug name and analyte are missing from the table itself. We can *infer* that the analyte is likely the same as the drug, but we *cannot* determine the drug name without the source.  We can *infer* that the specimen is likely plasma based on the PK parameters presented.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Format the Output:**  Given the missing drug name, I will represent it as \"Unknown Drug\" for now, acknowledging that this needs to be verified with the source.  I will also note the assumptions made about the analyte and specimen.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, assuming the analyte is the same as the drug and the specimen is plasma (both highly probable but require source verification), the answer would be:\n",
            "\n",
            "<<[[\"Unknown Drug\", \"Unknown Drug\", \"Plasma\"]]>>\n",
            "\n",
            "**Crucially, this answer is contingent on verifying the source material.**  The drug name *must* be identified from the source.  The assumptions about the analyte and specimen should also be confirmed.\n",

            "    * 13 to < 18 Years\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Subject N:**  The \"N\" row within each age group section specifies the number of subjects for which data is available for each parameter.  As the prompt indicates, these numbers can vary slightly within an age group due to data availability. We need to capture all of these \"N\" values.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Combining the Information:** For each age group, we'll create entries for each unique \"N\" value associated with it.\n",

            "1. **Examine Subtable 1 and the Main Table:** Subtable 1 provides the parameter types, but not the units. The main table includes units within some column headers (e.g., \"CL(mL/min/kg)\"), and the caption clarifies some terms.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Extract Parameter Types:** I'll use the more descriptive names from the caption where available. For example, \"T½Beta\" will become \"Elimination half-life\".\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Extract Parameter Units:** I'll carefully extract the units from the main table's column headers, ensuring they align with the corresponding parameter types.  I'll also correct any typos, such as \"CLmL/min/m)\" to \"CL(mL/min/m^2)\".  The unit for clearance normalized by body surface area should be mL/min/m^2.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Create the Lists:** I'll create two lists: \"Parameter type\" and \"Parameter unit\", ensuring they are in the correct order and correspond to rows 0-5.\n",
